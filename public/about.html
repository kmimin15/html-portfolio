<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Mario Kevin Garcia Carrazco. I studied at Universidad Tecnologica<br /> 
  General Mariano Escobedo, which is located in Nuevo Leon, Mexico. My bachelors deegre<br />
  is on Mechatronics. I decided to take this career to learn about robotics, and the<br />
  interation with the incoming data that comes from the sensors that the robots have.<br />
  Most f my career was taken in English due to there was an oportunity to take the BIS system of learning.</p>

<p>While studying that career I noticed I like programming in comparison to other type<br />
  of activities that was indicated to perform. I started strudying and practicing coding<br />
  with Python and later I got intrested in Computer Science. That is when I started to<br />
  look up for some courses on Udemy and EdX platforms.</p>

<p>After a while I decided that I wanted to deepen more into Software Engineer and Computing<br />
  Science. I began searching for some oportunities for studyin a masters deegree on the MIT or<br />
  Standford University, but that is when I needed some time to make some money and decide wheather<br />
  to go and study or stay and began working on a enterprise.
